== README

This README documents the steps necessary to get this application up and running.

=== System dependencies
  $ Rails 4.0.0
  $ Ruby 2.1.1
  $ PostgreSQL 9.3

=== Setting Up Postgres

==== Installation

Itâ€™s better to install Postgres through Homebrew to get the latest version and the development files. This command will download and compile Postgres:

  $ > brew install postgresql

Finish creating the database:

  $ > initdb /usr/local/var/postgres

=== Start Postgres

From the terminal, run:
  $ > pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start

Verify that you are running the correct instance:

  $ > psql --version
  $ psql (PostgreSQL) 9.1.3
  $ > which psql
  $ /usr/local/bin/psql

=== Local Variables

In the development and test environments, itâ€™s more convenient to have the database username be the same user in the local system. Create an application.yml file under /config and add your ENV variable(s). Mine looks like this:

  $ LOCAL_PG_USER: "carlisia"

=== Bundle the application

Inside the project directory, run the following command:

  $ > bundle

=== Database 

Create the application and test databases:

  $ rake db:create:all
  $ rake db:migrate
  $ rake db:test:prepare
  
=== Running the Tests

To run the unit tests:

  $ > rspec spec/models
  
To run the acceptance tests:

  $ > rspec spec/features
